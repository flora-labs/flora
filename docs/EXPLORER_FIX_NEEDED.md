# Explorer Connection Fix Required

## Current Status
- ✅ **Network Running**: 3 validators producing blocks (height 193+)
- ✅ **REST API Working**: All nodes have REST API on port 1317
- ❌ **Load Balancer Not Configured**: https://devnet-api.flora.network not routing
- ❌ **Explorer Can't Connect**: Needs the load balancer endpoint

## What's Working

### Direct Node Access (All Working)
```bash
# Latest block from nodes
curl http://52.9.17.25:1317/cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/blocks/latest
curl http://50.18.34.12:1317/cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/blocks/latest
curl http://204.236.162.240:1317/cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/blocks/latest

# Validators list
curl http://52.9.17.25:1317/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/validators

# All endpoints return valid data
```

## What's Not Working

### Load Balancer Endpoint
```bash
# This returns nothing (needs AWS ALB configuration)
curl https://devnet-api.flora.network/cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/blocks/latest
```

The explorer at https://explorer.flora.network/flora-devnet is configured to use `https://devnet-api.flora.network` which is an AWS Application Load Balancer that needs to be configured to route to the nodes.

## AWS Configuration Needed

### Option 1: Configure Existing ALB
The Application Load Balancer at `devnet-api.flora.network` needs:

1. **Target Group**: Add the 3 nodes as targets
   - 52.9.17.25:1317
   - 50.18.34.12:1317
   - 204.236.162.240:1317

2. **Health Check**: Configure health check path
   - Path: `/cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/blocks/latest`
   - Expected: HTTP 200
   - Interval: 30 seconds

3. **Listener Rules**: HTTPS:443 → HTTP:1317

### Option 2: Update Explorer Config
Alternative: Update the explorer to connect directly to one of the nodes:
- Change endpoint from `https://devnet-api.flora.network`
- To: `http://52.9.17.25:1317`

## Temporary Workaround

For immediate testing, you can:
1. Use SSH tunnel to access the REST API:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/esprezzo/norcal-pub.pem -L 1317:localhost:1317 ubuntu@52.9.17.25
# Then access http://localhost:1317 locally
```

2. Or configure your local explorer instance to use direct node IP

## Summary

| Component | Status | Issue |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Blockchain | ✅ Running | None |
| Validators | ✅ Active (3/3) | None |
| REST API | ✅ Working on nodes | None |
| Load Balancer | ❌ Not configured | Needs AWS ALB setup |
| Explorer | ❌ Can't connect | Waiting for load balancer |

## Next Steps

1. **AWS Admin Action Required**: Configure the ALB at `devnet-api.flora.network`
2. **Add EC2 instances to target group**
3. **Configure health checks**
4. **Test endpoint**: `curl https://devnet-api.flora.network/cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/blocks/latest`
5. **Explorer will auto-connect once ALB is configured**

**Note**: The blockchain is fully operational. This is only an infrastructure/routing issue.
